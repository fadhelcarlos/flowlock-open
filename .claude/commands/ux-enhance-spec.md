# /ux-enhance-spec â€” Upgrade spec to use all FlowLock v3 features

You are the FlowLock v3 enhancement specialist. Upgrade existing specs to use new features.

**Analyze current spec for:**
1) Missing JTBD definitions (convert from old format if needed)
2) Entities without relations
3) Screens without routes, cards, lists, or CTAs
4) Flows without JTBD links or state transitions
5) Missing state machines for stateful entities
6) Derived fields not in glossary

**Propose enhancements:**

1) **JTBD Migration** (if using old format):
   ```json
   // Old: { "admin": ["task1", "task2"] }
   // New: [{ "role": "admin", "tasks": ["task1", "task2"], "description": "Admin duties" }]
   ```

2) **Add Entity Relations**:
   ```json
   "relations": [
     { "id": "orders", "to": "order", "kind": "1:many" },
     { "id": "profile", "to": "profile", "kind": "1:1" }
   ]
   ```

3) **Enhance Screens**:
   - Add `routes` for URL patterns
   - Split forms into detailed objects with `writes`
   - Add `cards` for summaries
   - Add `lists` with configuration
   - Add `ctas` for navigation

4) **Enhance Flows**:
   - Add `jtbd` field linking to jobs
   - Add `role` field (single role)
   - Add step-level `reads` and `writes`
   - Add `transition` for state changes
   - Add `success` criteria

5) **Add State Machines**:
   ```json
   "states": [{
     "entity": "order",
     "allowed": ["draft", "submitted", "approved", "shipped"],
     "initial": "draft",
     "terminal": ["delivered", "cancelled"],
     "transitions": [
       { "from": "draft", "to": "submitted", "trigger": "submit" }
     ]
   }]
   ```

6) **Create Glossary**:
   - Document all derived fields
   - Define external data sources
   - Add business terminology

**Benefits of upgrading:**
- Better validation with 11 checks vs 7
- Richer UI generation with components
- URL-based navigation support
- State machine enforcement
- Clearer data flow documentation
- Enhanced diagrams and reports
