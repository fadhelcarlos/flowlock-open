# Graduated Validation Levels - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Implemented graduated validation levels in FlowLock CLI to allow progressive validation based on project maturity and requirements.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **`/packages/cli/src/commands/audit.ts`**:
   - Added `level` option to `AuditOptions` interface
   - Created `VALIDATION_LEVELS` configuration object defining three levels
   - Added `shouldRunCheck()` function to filter checks by level
   - Modified `printSummary()` to display level header and filter output
   - Updated `auditCommand()` to:
     - Accept and validate level parameter (default: 'enhanced')
     - Auto-enable inventory for 'strict' level
     - Filter check results based on selected level
     - Include level info in JSON output

2. **`/packages/cli/src/index.ts`**:
   - Added `--level <level>` option to audit command with description

3. **`/packages/cli/README.md`**:
   - Updated audit command documentation with validation levels
   - Added detailed explanations for each level
   - Included practical examples for all levels
   - Added inventory command documentation

## Validation Levels

### 1. Basic Level
- **Purpose**: Core checks only for essential UX consistency
- **Checks**: HONEST, CREATABLE, REACHABILITY, UI, STATE, SCREEN, SPEC
- **Total checks**: 7 (core checks only)
- **Use case**: Quick validation during development
- **Command**: `npx flowlock-uxcg audit --level=basic`

### 2. Enhanced Level (Default)
- **Purpose**: Basic + extended checks for comprehensive validation
- **Additional checks**: JTBD, RELATIONS, ROUTES, CTAS, RUNTIME_DETERMINISM
- **Total checks**: 12 (7 core + 5 extended)
- **Use case**: Standard validation for most projects
- **Command**: `npx flowlock-uxcg audit` or `npx flowlock-uxcg audit --level=enhanced`

### 3. Strict Level
- **Purpose**: Enhanced + runtime checks for full system validation
- **Additional checks**: INVENTORY, DATABASE_VALIDATION, MIGRATION_VALIDATION
- **Total checks**: 15 (7 core + 5 extended + 3 runtime)
- **Requirements**: Runtime inventory must exist (auto-enabled)
- **Use case**: Production-ready validation
- **Command**: 
  ```bash
  npx flowlock-uxcg inventory  # Generate inventory first
  npx flowlock-uxcg audit --level=strict
  ```

## Key Features

1. **Progressive Validation**: Start with basic checks and increase strictness as project matures
2. **Default to Enhanced**: Balanced default that covers most validation needs
3. **Auto-inventory for Strict**: Automatically requires inventory when using strict level
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Helpful guidance when inventory is missing for strict level
5. **JSON Support**: All levels support JSON output for CI/CD integration
6. **Works with --fix**: Auto-fix capability available at all levels

## Example Usage

```bash
# During early development - quick checks only
npx flowlock-uxcg audit --level=basic

# Standard development - comprehensive validation
npx flowlock-uxcg audit --level=enhanced

# Pre-production - full system validation
npx flowlock-uxcg inventory
npx flowlock-uxcg audit --level=strict

# CI/CD integration with JSON output
npx flowlock-uxcg audit --level=enhanced --json

# Auto-fix issues at any level
npx flowlock-uxcg audit --level=basic --fix
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Feedback Loop**: Basic level runs quickly for rapid development
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Teams can start with basic and increase strictness over time
3. **Flexibility**: Choose appropriate level based on project phase
4. **Clear Documentation**: Each level clearly documented with use cases
5. **Backward Compatible**: Default behavior unchanged (enhanced level)
